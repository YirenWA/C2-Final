The artwork "Touching Transformation" invites viewers to mimic and explore the activities of biological colonies, growth and variation, forming stunning patterns and shapes through the use of open frameworks and Arduino. These "organisms" interact with each other, attracting and repelling each other. Viewers trigger the "mutations" of these organisms and observe the beautiful diversity of the colony.

I use a variety of colors and structures to create patterns with depth and texture, attempting to express the relationship and interaction between humans, nature, and technology. The artwork allows viewers to experience the wonder and beauty of the microcosm and to reconsider the internal and external interactions and dependencies of ecosystems.

Technically, I used Arduino to control the color and shape inheritance polymorphism of boids in open frameworks, limiting their movements within circular vessels. Each colony has three different variations.
